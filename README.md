## 📊 Project Overview  
This project is part of the **Sprint 8: Data Collection and Storage (SQL)** module at TripleTen Latam.  
As a data analyst for the fictional ride-sharing company **Zuber** in Chicago, the goal was to explore patterns in ride data, understand passenger preferences, and evaluate the impact of **external factors like weather** on trip duration.

## 🛠️ Tasks Completed  
1. **SQL Queries**  
   - Retrieved ride counts for different taxi companies.  
   - Grouped companies by "Yellow" or "Blue" keywords.  
   - Compared Flash Cab and Taxi Affiliation Services vs. "Other".  
   - Joined ride data with weather conditions.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)**  
   - Imported SQL query results into CSV files.  
   - Analyzed ride completions by neighborhood.  
   - Visualized taxi company market shares.  
   - Plotted the top 10 neighborhoods by ride drop-offs.  

3. **Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Tested whether **average ride duration from Loop to O’Hare changes on rainy Saturdays**.  
   - Formulated null and alternative hypotheses.  
   - Applied statistical testing at a chosen significance level (α).

## 📂 Dataset Description  
The project used SQL queries and CSV exports:  
- `project_sql_result_01.csv`: trips per company (Nov 15–16, 2017).  
- `project_sql_result_04.csv`: average trips completed by neighborhood (Nov 2017).  
- `project_sql_result_07.csv`: trips from Loop to O’Hare with weather conditions and duration.
